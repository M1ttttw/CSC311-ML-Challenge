# CSC311-ML-Challenge
This is a group project done in Spring 2024. This was our attempt to make a Machine Learning model that predicts which of the 4 cities ('Dubai', 'New York City', 'Paris', 'Rio de Janeiro') a survey's response was for. We made this as a group of 3 students.

Instructions: Open the .ipynb file in google colab! There will be further instructions on what to do to run the various colab code snippets inside the colab file itself. It will require you to use your personal google drive, so be sure to set that up as well.
